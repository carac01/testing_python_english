### Introduction to testing

Talking about testing we want to refer the empirical verification in order to improve the quality of our code.<br>
The complex of techniques which helps to assess the Fault Tolerance.<br>
There are a lot of options, Frameworks and guides nowadays.<br>
The most important among them that we might find:

#### Philosophies/Methodologies
> Test-Driven Development (TDD).<br>
> Behavior-Driven Development (BDD).<br>
> Domain-Driven Design (DDD).<br>

#### Testing that depends on the code visibility
> White-box testing.<br>
> Grey-box testing.<br>
> Black-box testing.<br>

#### Testing that depends on the application execution
> Static testing.<br>
> Dynamic testing.<br>

#### Functional testing that are performed on all test levels (what?)
> Component testing.<br>
> Integration testing.<br>
> System testing.<br>
> Acceptance/E2E testing.<br>

#### Non-functional testing (how well?)
> Performance testing.<br>
> Security testing.<br>
> Portability testing.<br>
> Reliability testing.<br>
> Usability testing.<br>

#### Testing that depends on the numbers of test or spent time
> Smoke testing.<br>
> Sanity checks.<br>
> Regression testing.<br>
