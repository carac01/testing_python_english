The component tests or Unit testing is the methodology in order to check that the function works as expected.<br>
Trying to get the boundaries for quality assure as a result.<br>
In addition, it gives the confidence, feel of safety and peace of mind when new characteristics are added because
it notifies about code stops working.<br>

Though from the first glance it feels like we are waisting the time, 
but in fact the testing optimises the code and makes the project rentable.<br> 
How is it possible?<br>
The test development opens the opportunity to find the new issues - it will reduce the quantity of issues in a future
and there are fewer hours spent to resolve the problem consequently.
Nevertheless, the productivity of the project is low at the beginning.
We could observe this fact on the next graphic:
