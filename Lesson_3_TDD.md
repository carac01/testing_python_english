### TDD

Test-Driven Development is the most used practice of programming for developers.
Its main idea is in the design which is opposite the traditional testing, first add tests then - new code if it fails.
Probably, the reason of its being is not clear because of its abstractness.
Let's observe the example of the cycle for developing the Homo sapiens:
1. Create the world.
2. Populate the world with ancient people.
3. Perform changes: teach the people think, survive, talk, build house etc.
4. Teach people again till they could communicate and resolve conflicts.
5. Finally, the people could perfectly survive with each other and have healthy communication.
6. Perform refactoring: make the world safety and trust.
