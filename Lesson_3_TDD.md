### TDD

Test-Driven Development is the most used practice of programming for developers.
Its main idea is in the design which is opposite the traditional testing, first add tests then - new code if it fails.
Probably, the reason of its being is not clear because of its abstractness.
Let's observe the cycle of developing the sword:
1. Create the sword case for the sword.
2. Forge the sword and introduce it.
3. Perform minimal numbers of hammering to get adequate form od sword.
4. Try to fit the sword in the sword case again. If it fails - perform hammering again.
5. Finally, the sword fits perfectly to the sword case. 
6. Perform refactoring: remove impurity and add shine.
